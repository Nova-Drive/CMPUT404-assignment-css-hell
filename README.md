Project Gutenberg Modifications
===============================

I changed the background to a darker shade of gray, emulating dark mode. I also changed the paragraph and header colours
to match. I went with 2 main different header colours, with h2 also becoming much larger and having impact font.
Paragraph character spacing was decreased, font set to Times, and font size decreased. Various other small changes were made,
mainly to match dark mode. For images, I gave a white border and rounded edges. Image captions are in cursive for no
specific reason. I left every image alone except the ulysses cover, and the same with some image captions as editing 300+ 
captions and images is dumb.
