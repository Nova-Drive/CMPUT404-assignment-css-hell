    <h2>What can I offer?</h2>
    <div>
        <p class="al">I value honesty, communication, pride in one's work, and perfecting my craft. Regardless of the task at hand, I always aim to do my best.
            When I need help, I'm not afraid to reach out. I believe that every line of code is a judge of my character.
